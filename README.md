# Traits-and-strategies-of-specialist-cliff-plants-in-the-Pyrenees

This is the project for the supplementary information of the master thesis: "Specialist plants on vertical calcareous cliffs in the Pyrenees share common traits and strategies"

It is composed of 5 folders:

-   **Code**: Where the main script is "TFM_code.R". It is really detailed and explained.

-   **Figures**: With the 4 main figures of the manuscript. They get done running the code

-   **Maps**: With some download layers needed to run the maps code, do to Figure 1: map

-   **Raw_data**: The folder where the file Rawdata_Cirera_TFM.csv is, the raw data from which the code starts.
